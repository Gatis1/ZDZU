 CS-596 Final Game

ZDZU
Zombie-Diego Ztate University

Description - A beat-em-up zombie survival game that takes place at SDSU itself. The main characters find themselves trapped on the SDSU campus during a zombie apocalypse and have to fight their way out. This involves pathing through the school, with multiple routes each route giving you different encounters, from a weapons room to zombie hoards. Navigation through campus is the only way to freedom!

Gameplay - 
	Map - The map contains multiple paths based on the real-world SDSU map. The locations in-game will be displayed through photos taken and added as a skybox with shaders applied (1).
	Graphics and Sound - for the most part, this will be done mainly through free assets. There are cases where custom assets will be needed, such as scripted cutscenes, self-insertions, and crosshairs. 
	X-Factors - Mobile game, custom shaders for SDSU locations, ai (optional), enemy variety (optional)
	Gameplay Loop - Players will progress through the map while being able to choose which path they want to go along. The end of each mini route leads to a location with either an encounter and/or a reward/powerup. The player will be armed with one of a choice of “weapons”, which to keep this PG, will be sports equipment. This includes a baseball bat and baseballs for ammo, a volleyball, etc, each with their uses, animations, and damage styles. We plan to add complex enemy pathing and behavior, including trying to dodge the player’s attacks and not clumping up. No matter what path is chosen, there will only be a limited amount of rooms within each path before the player reaches the exit.
